**Sign2Text** is an innovative project that aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and deaf communities by providing real-time conversion of sign language gestures into text. Leveraging advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning models, this project strives to create an accessible and intuitive communication tool.

## Features

* **Real-time Conversion:** Processes video input to instantly translate sign language gestures into text.
* **Multiple Sign Language Support (Planned):** Currently supports [Specify supported sign language(s) here, e.g., American Sign Language (ASL)]. Future development aims to include support for various sign languages.
* **Customizable Models (Future):** Potential for users to train and integrate custom sign language recognition models.
* **User-Friendly Interface (Future):** Intended to have a simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
* **Open Source:** The project is open-source, encouraging community contributions and further development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3 or a later version installed on your system.
* **Dependencies:** Install the necessary Python libraries. You can typically do this using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file outlining the necessary libraries will be included in the repository.)*

* **Webcam or Video Input:** A webcam or other video input device is required for real-time gesture recognition.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Revuubot/sign2text.git](https://github.com/Revuubot/sign2text.git)
    cd sign2text
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Make sure the `requirements.txt` file in the repository lists all the necessary libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.)*

### Usage

1.  **Run the main script:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    *(Replace `main.py` with the actual name of the main execution script in the repository.)*

2.  **Follow on-screen instructions:** The application should open a window displaying the video feed from your webcam. Perform sign language gestures in front of the camera, and the corresponding text output should be displayed in real-time.
